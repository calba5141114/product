                <p class="mb-0"> My girlfriend and I enjoy eating out, and when we see restaurants with poorly designed websites we see that 
                    as a reflection of their restaurants. If people aren't willing to take care of their websites its usually the same thing 
                    for their restaurants.

                What Ryan experienced is very common and is a deal breaker for most people. Restauraunt food and service is very elastic (expendable)
                so first impressions and prices can drive away most customers. If you can't attract clientelle your competitors
                will.

                    I really needed plain t-shirts for a community event. I found a site that sold the Hanes t-shirts I needed but I was confused
                    as to how to contact the shop or even find it. I ended up going to Michaels and buying Gildan shirts instead.

                Making overcomplicated websites is the number one way to turn way potential customers. This is very common for clothing 
                websites. Luis was so frustrated with the sites inability to provide simple and easy contact information and payment information.

            At A&L we follow the design style of the German designer and architect Dieter Rams he believes in the idea of Simplicity
            and functionality the idea that an object should not stand out in the background until it is needed this works
            very well for a site because we can focus on your products and services this will result in higher conversions
            than on a poorly formatted and designed website.
